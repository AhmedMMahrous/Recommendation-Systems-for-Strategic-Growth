## Introduction
This project aims to perform Market Basket Analysis using Python to identify frequent itemsets and generate association rules. This analysis helps retail businesses understand product combinations that customers frequently purchase together, aiding in marketing strategies and inventory management.


## Project Structure

- **`1-Importing Libraries: .`**: Importing essential libraries for data processing and visualization
- **`2-Importing Dataset:`**: Loading the dataset from a CSV file.
- **`3-Basic Data Exploration:`**: Understanding the dataset by checking its head, shape, data types, and summary.
- **`4-Data Cleaning:`**: Cleaning the data by dropping unrelated columns, null values, duplicate values, and handling dirty columns and outliers.
- **`5-Feature Engineering:`**: Creating new features like Total Price, Year, Month, Day of Week, Day Name, and Hour.
- **`6-Data Analysis:`**:  Performing analysis to understand sales on different days of the week, average revenue of each day of every month, and identifying the top 10 most popular items.
- **`7-Frequent Pattern Mining:`**:  Utilized Apriori algorithm to identify item patterns.
- **`8-Recommendation Generation:`**:  Created association rules to guide sales strategies.

## Usage

1. Load the provided dataset in the required format.

2. Execute the provided scripts or notebooks for analysis.
